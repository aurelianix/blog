Hi, my name is Leo. This blog is my hundredth attempt at keeping up with writing and sharing my thoughts. It's for me, but I hope you find something interesting here too. My main goal is to increase my writing skills and have a sink for my thoughts.

I'm a backend developer by day and a backend developer by night. Professionally, I code in go and TypeScript, but I've grown quite tired of both. I always want to learn something new, and currently I've settled on F# after a brief stint with Rust.
